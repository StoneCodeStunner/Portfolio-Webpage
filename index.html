         <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
         <p> I got out of high school went straight to work in a factory. I spent a few years just getting by. Then I went into security and it still didn't pay well so I returned back to factory work for 6 more years. I've learned that I have to push to get to the success I want, to be happy in what I do. I found that happiness in programming. And with that happiness one day I will receive that success. Then I started searching and started learning HTML/CSS on my own and I haven't looked back since. This is a journey I will never give up on. As soon as my feet hit the floor I'm excited to jump on my computer and start writing code and solving code. I'm ready to be on a team collaberating to make apps and websites better and more user friendly. I'm ready to listen and learn and contribute in way needed on a development team.To solve what at times could seem like the unsolvable. Outside of coding I love music. I like playing my guitar and writing new songs. I like going swimming and enjoying a summer day. I just wake up and look at the best of each day not thinking about what could happen.</p>
