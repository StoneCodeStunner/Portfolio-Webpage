         <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
         <p> I got out of high school went straight to work in a factory. I spent a few years just getting by. Then I went into security and it still didn't pay well so I returned back to factory work for 6 more years. I've learned that I have to push to get to the success I want, to be happy in what I do. I found that happiness in programming. And with that happiness one day I will receive that success. Then I started searching and started learning HTML/CSS on my own and I haven't looked back since. This is a journey I will never give up on.</p>
